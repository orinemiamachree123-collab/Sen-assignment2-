## Project Overview
This project is a **Simple Calculator Web App** created as part of the **SEN 201 assignment**.  
It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** directly in a web browser.  

The project also displays the student information at the top of the page:


This project demonstrates the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** using a small, interactive web application.


## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


## How to Run
1. Download or clone the project folder.  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.  
3. Use the buttons to perform calculations.


## SDLC Explanation

### 1. Planning
The project goal was to create a simple and functional calculator that works in the browser.  
It was chosen because it is small, easy to understand, and allows demonstration of the Software Development Life Cycle clearly.

### 2. Requirement Analysis
- Must perform basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`  
- Must display input and results clearly  
- Must be user-friendly and visually organized

### 3. Design
- Single web page layout  
- Display area for input and results  
- Buttons for numbers 0–9, decimal point, operations, clear, and equals  
- External CSS file for styling  
- Layout structured in a clean grid  

### 4. Implementation
- HTML used to structure the page and buttons  
- CSS used for styling and layout  
- JavaScript added for button functionality and calculation logic  

### 5. Testing
- Opened the page in multiple browsers  
- Verified that all operations work correctly  
- Ensured the display shows input and results without errors  

### 6. Deployment
- Project files uploaded to GitHub  
- Accessible online via the repository  

### 7. Maintenance
- Future updates could include more advanced operations  
- Styling improvements or responsive design for mobile devices


## Conclusion
This Simple Calculator project is a complete demonstration of the SDLC using a small, interactive web application.  
It is fully functional, visually organized, and ready for submission as part of the **SEN 201 assignment**.
